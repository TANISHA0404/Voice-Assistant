# Voice-Assistant
The elderly, the visually and physically handicapped, children, and others benefit from virtual assistants since engaging with machines is no longer a challenge. Even blind people who can’t see the computer can communicate with it simply by speaking to it.

Today with the advent of technology ,a computer
system which could do only a few tasks, can now perform
any type of tasks using machine learning, artificial intelligence,
deep learning.In such an era of advancement, if people are still
struggling to interact using various input devices, then it’s not
worth it.
For this reason, I developed a voice assistant using python
which allows the user to interact with a bot.Personal assistants
that can carry out activities for everyday needs with just a simple
phrase is a rapidly increasing field nowadays. It uses both text
and audio data to figure out and analyze what the individual is
saying.

Voice recognition, also known as speech recognition
or automatic speech recognition (ASR), is a remarkable
technology that enables computers and machines to understand
and interpret human speech.
Voice control is one of the important developments of
human-machine interaction, which was possible because
of advancement in Artificial Intelligence.Voice assistance
engages users like no other interface. Users can speak to the
applications naturally to ask for whatever they’d like.
The elderly, the visually and physically handicapped, children,
and others benefit from virtual assistants since engaging with
machines is no longer a challenge. Even blind people who
can’t see the computer can communicate with it simply by
speaking to it.
Our model focuses on converting speech to voice and then
using open AI sources to respond to the texts and then convert
those texts to speech.
Voice recognition technology has not only simplified humancomputer
interactions but has also made it more accessible to
people with disabilities or those who prefer a more intuitive
way of interacting with technology.
